# Quiz Game

> A quiz is a form of game or mind sport in which players attempt to answer questions correctly about a certain or variety of subjects. Quizzes can be used as a brief assessment in education and similar fields to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, or skills.

## Motivation: 

I've chosen to do a quiz game for two reasons. First, I used to love quizzes. Ever since a little girl, quizzes were always great fun for me.
And second, I think quizzes are great to help knowledge sink in, so I thought it would be fun to be able to create something that could be useful in education.
