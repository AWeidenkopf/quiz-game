# quiz-game

Motivation: 

I've chosen to do a quiz game for two reasons. First: I used to love quizzes. Ever since a little girl, quizzes were always great fun for me.
And second, I think quizzes are great to help knowledge sink in, so I thought it would be fun to be able to create something that could be useful for education.
